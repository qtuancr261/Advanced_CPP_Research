C++11 Concurrency brief tutorial

The C++98 standard doesn't acknowledge the existence of threads (mostly used C APIs for multithreading - such as POSIX C or Microsoft Windows API (platform-specific extensions) | boost library,....)
With the release of the new C++ standard, there is not only a brandnew thread-aware memory model, but include classes for managing threads, protecting shared data,
, synchronizing operations betweeen threads and low-level atomic operations (based on the prior experience through the use of the C++ class libs memtoned previously
, the Boost Thread library has been used as the primary model on which the new library is based)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ProtectingDataMutex: using mutex (mutual excusion) in C++11 to protect shared data between threads
 - Race Conditions: occur where completing an operation requires modification of two or more distinct pieces of data, such as the two link pointer in double-linked list node, another thread could potentially access the data structure
when only one of them has been completed.
 - Often very hard to find and hard to duplicate because it is generally timing sensitive 
 - Using:
   -> manually: creating an instance of std::mutex and call its member function lock() - unlock() (shouldn't use this way)
   -> practically: use std::lock_guard for a std::mutex , it will lock the associate mutex by the std::lock_guard contructor and unlock by the destructor

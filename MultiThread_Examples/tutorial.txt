The C++98 standard doesn't acknowledge the existence of threads (mostly used C APIs for multithreading - such as POSIX C or Microsoft Windows API (platform-specific extensions) | boost library,....)
With the release of the new C++ standard, there is not only a brandnew thread-aware memory model, but include classes for managing threads, protecting shared data,
, synchronizing operations betweeen threads and low-level atomic operations (based on the prior experience through the use of the C++ class libs memtoned previously
, the Boost Thread library has been used as the primary model on which the new library is based)
